# TaskFCRemoveMeanActivity

Code for running simulations and data analysis from:
Cole MW, Ito T, Schultz D, Mill R, Chen R, Cocuzza C (Preprint) "Task activations produce spurious but systematic inflation of task functional connectivity estimates". bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/292045

[Minimal model](minimalmodel/MinimalModel.ipynb): A simple model with easy-to-read Python code to demonstrate the basic activation-based task-state FC inflation effect and an effective way to correct the issue.

*empiricalfMRIAnalyses* directory: MATLAB code used for empirical fMRI analyses. Start with *masterscript.m*. Please note that the code has not been tested for use on other servers, version of MATLAB, etc. Feel free to contact the corresponding author with questions.
