[Minimal model](minimalmodel/MinimalModel.ipynb): A simple model with easy-to-read Python code to demonstrate the basic activation-based task-state FC inflation effect and an effective way to correct the issue.

[Neural mass model](neuralmassmodel/NeuralMassModel.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook implementing the neural mass model reported in the paper.
